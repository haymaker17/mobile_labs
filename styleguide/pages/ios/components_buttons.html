<p>A button consists of text and/or an image that clearly communicates what action will occur when the user touches it. Two main types of buttons are used: Process buttons, and Ancillary buttons.</p>
<h3>Process Buttons</h3>
	<div class="flexContainer half">
		<div>
			<p>Process buttons are generally locked to the bottom of the screen and span the full width of the screen. They are used to complete a major process like booking a flight, reserving a hotel, or creating a new expense. Sometimes these buttons will have a total price displayed on it to reinforce to the user that taking action on the button will result in a charge. In this case, we generally use the "slide to..." mechanism to bypass displaying a confirmation dialog.</p>

<h3>Ancillary Buttons</h3>
	<div class="flexContainer half">
		<div>
			<p>Ancillary buttons come in all shapes and sizes. They generally are displayed as just text such as the buttons on the filter/sort bar. They may also include icons or use a more stylized approach such as the "Start a new request" button shown on the right. </p>
