			<p>A navbar enables navigation through an information hierarchy and, optionally, management of screen contents. The navbar consists of the page title (when applicable) and navigation buttons and icons such as "close", "back", or an "overflow" icon. If the title is too long, it will be truncated with an ellipses. When there's a back arrow (pointing to the left) present, along with it is some text indicating where the button will take you. However if the page title is too long, the back context text is removed and just the arrow is shown. </p>
