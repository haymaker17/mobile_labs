<h3>Lists</h3>
	<div class="flexContainer half">
		<div>
			<p>A list consists of a single continuous column of sub-divisions of equal width that function as containers for content. Each list row may vary in height. Lists are best suited to presenting a homogeneous data type or sets of data types, such as images and text, optimized for reading comprehension, with the goal of differentiating between like data types or qualities within a single type of data.</p>

<h3>Cards</h3>
	<div class="flexContainer half">
		<div>
			<p>As an alternative to displaying information in a list, you may choose to use the card metaphor. Cards are a convenient means of displaying content composed of different types of objects. They're also well-suited for presenting similar objects whose size or supported actions can vary considerably, like photos with captions of variable length. </p>

<h3>Forms</h3>
	<div class="flexContainer half">
		<div>
			<p>Form fields allow the user to input text. There are various types of form fields such as text entry, picker, toggles, sliders et. They can be single line, multi-line, and can have an icon. </p>
			<h4>Text Fields</h4>
			<p>Touching a text field places the cursor and automatically displays the keyboard. In addition to typing, text fields allow for a variety of other tasks, such as text selection (cut, copy, paste) and data lookup via auto-completion. </p>
			<p>When a text field is empty, the label or title of the text field is displayed centered in the field. Once the field is selected, the label shrinks and moves up to allow space for the entered text. This is all done in-line, staying on the current screen. </p>
			<h4>List Picker</h4>
			<p>When a form field has a right-pointing arrow on the right-hand-side, this indicates that there is a sub-menu available with a secondary list of items to choose from. Once the choice is made, the screen immediately "pushes" back to the original form field with the new text filled in.</p>
			<h4>Required Fields</h4>
			<p>Required fields are pre-filled in with "*Field name* is required" and is colored <a href="#pages/ios/colors.html?&cat=iOS&parent=iOS&title=Colors">red</a>. When the user taps on the field, the field is cleared out automatically so the user doesn't have to clear it manually. If a form is submitted and a required field is not filled out, the user is presented with an <a href="#pages/ios/components_overlays.html?&cat=iOS&parent=Components&title=Overlays">overlay</a> stating such. In addition, the required fields are indicated in red and the page is automatically scrolled to the first unfilled required field.</p>
			<h4>Dates</h4>
			<p>When possible, we show dates written out as a day of the week and then month, for example: <i>Tuesday, January 5</i>. If that's not possible it may be shortened to: <i>Tue, Jan 5</i>. </p>

<h3>Dividers</h3>
	<div class="flexContainer half">
		<div>
			<p>Dividers group and separate content within lists and page layouts using strong visual and spatial distinctions. When lists don't have an anchoring element such as an icon, spacing alone isn't always enough to separate blocks of information. In this case, dividers can help create rhythm and separate individual blocks.</p>

<h3>Maps</h3>
	<div class="flexContainer half">

<h3>View Controllers</h3>
	<div class="flexContainer half">
		<div>
			<p>Segmented Controls â€“ A segmented control is a linear set of segments, each of which functions as a button that can display a different view. Use a segmented control to offer choices that are closely related but mutually exclusive. If there is content above the segmented controller, it is NOT affected by the controller. Be sure if you use this paradigm that the content above the segmented controller applies to all segments.</p>
