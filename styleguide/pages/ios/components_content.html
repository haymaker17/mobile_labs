<h3>Lists</h3>
	<div class="flexContainer half">
		<div>
			<p>A list consists of a single continuous column of sub-divisions of equal width that function as containers for content. Each list row may vary in height. Lists are best suited to presenting a homogeneous data type or sets of data types, such as images and text, optimized for reading comprehension, with the goal of differentiating between like data types or qualities within a single type of data.</p>

<h3>Cards</h3>
	<div class="flexContainer half">
		<div>
			<p>Cards are a convenient means of displaying content composed of different types of objects. They’re also well-suited for presenting similar objects whose size or supported actions can vary considerably, like photos with captions of variable length. Cards may have 100% width or 50% width but within the same group, the widths should be consistent.</p>

<h3>Forms</h3>
	<div class="flexContainer half">
		<div>
			<p>Form fields allow the user to input text. There are various types of form fields such as text entry, picker, toggles, sliders et. They can be single line, multi-line, and can have an icon. </p>
			<h4>Text Fields</h4>
			<p>Touching a text field places the cursor and automatically displays the keyboard. In addition to typing, text fields allow for a variety of other tasks, such as text selection (cut, copy, paste) and data lookup via auto-completion. When a text field is empty, the label or title of the text field is displayed centered in the field. Once the field is tapped on, the label shrinks and moves up to allow space for the entered text. This is all done inline, staying on the current screen. If a field has a right-pointing arrow, this indicates a tap will take the user to a secondary page - generally a list of pre-populated items to chooose from.</p>
			<h4>List Picker</h4>
			<p>When a form field has a right-pointing arrow on the right-hand-side, this indicates that there is another screen present - generally with a list of items to choose from. Once the choice is made, the screen immidiately "pushes" back to the original form field with the new text filled in.</p>
			<h4>Optional and Required Fields</h4>
			<p>Since most fields in Concur Mobile are required, we've chosen to indicate the optional fields instead of the required ones. This allows for a more streamlined interface. If a form is submitted and a requred field is not filled out, the user is presnted with an overlay stating such. In addition, the required fields are indicated in red and the page is automatically scrolled to the first unfilled required field.</p>

<h3>Dividers</h3>
	<div class="flexContainer half">
		<div>
			<p>Dividers group and separate content within lists and page layouts using strong visual and spatial distinctions. When lists don’t have an anchoring element such as an avatar or icon, spacing alone isn’t always enough to separate blocks of information. In this case, dividers can help create rhythm and separate individual blocks.</p>

<h3>Maps</h3>
	<div class="flexContainer half">
		<div>
			<p>Map views use the built-in maps provided by Apple. We use the location indicator from the Concur icon sheet. When a location is selected (tapped on), the indicator item turns from blue to red.</p>

<h3>View Controllers</h3>
	<div class="flexContainer half">
		<div>
			<p>Segmented Controls - A segmented control is a linear set of segments, each of which functions as a button that can display a different view. Use a segmented control to offer choices that are closely related but mutually exclusive.</p>
