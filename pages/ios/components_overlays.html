<h3>Toasts</h3>

		<div>
			<p>Toasts are a way means of notifying or alerting the user there's an action has taken place or something has gone wrong. For example, when a form is submitted without a required field, a Toast may come up to alert the user to fill in the required field. They are usually accompanied by some other action since the toast dismisses after a couple of seconds, like in the required field instance, the required fields would also be highlighted. </p>
